# Opening

I've decided to do three things:

* Start meditating again
* Learn some kind of shorthand
* Publicly write about my progress

Here are my reasons:

# Meditation

There is [evidence][1] (compelling to me, at least) that meditation makes one behave more morally. I tried it a while ago, and when I was doing it regularly, I felt better; however, I let my habit lapse. I'm trying to get back into it. I intend to follow a particular [course][4]. My reasoning for doing so rather than just meditating for some time every morning is influenced by [these][2] [two][3] posts; basically, it's a lot easier for me to either abandon it or mutate it into something useless if I don't commit to something specific.

# Shorthand

I've often found myself in situations when being able to jot down my ideas faster than I can type (or sometimes write, when I was not at a computer) would have been useful. I've tried in the past to learn [Gregg shorthand][5]; I even bought used manuals and a shorthand dictionary. I couldn't stick with it. I also tried to use [plover][6] (a cool project you should check out). I'm settling on [keyscript][7], which has the advantage of being an alphabetic system, so is portable between typing and writing.

# Writing

If I post this and never post again, I'll feel guilty; anyone reading (well, I doubt anyone will actually read this, but it's at least possible in principle) will know I've failed in my stated goals. I will similarly feel guilty if I write but have no progress. I believe that this will encourage me to actually work toward my goals rather than just abandoning them. I intend to write about once a week; I think this is a good balance between reasonable (not, for example, every day) and urgent (not, for example, every month).

# Public Commitment

I commit to doing the Aro meditation course, studying Keyscript shorthand, and publicly writing about my progress once a week.
